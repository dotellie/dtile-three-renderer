# DTile Three Renderer
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/magnonellie/dtile-three-renderer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/magnonellie/dtile-three-renderer)

dtile-three-renderer is a renderer made with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
for rendering tilemaps on the web.

### Design decisions
- Tiles are ***not*** rendered with sprites, but instead use planes. This allows us to bring DTile to the third dimension in the future.
- It's ***not*** continuously updating. You have to manually update the renderer when you make a change to camera, tiles, size, etc. This is to save performance when it's not in use. This may backfire in the future once we start involving animations, but for now, I think this works.
- There are ***no*** tests. I find it incredibly difficult to find a good way to test front-end stuff and since this is essentially just a layer over three, I decided tests wouldn't be too useful for now. Therefore, the test command just executes a lint.
- There is probably a whole lot more which belongs to this section, but I can't come to think of them right now. xP

## Contributing
Any contribution, be it bugs, suggestions, code or whatever, is ***hugely*** appreciated, so don't be shy, please!

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/magnonellie/dtile-three-renderer.git`.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start a local web-server. You should then be able to open `localhost:8080/demo` in your browser where you can try out your changes.
4. Feel free to add stuff to `demo/index.html` so that it can be used as a full-featured demo!

You should also keep in mind that this project uses es6 without transpiling, so you need to have a recent browser that supports es6! I personally recommend Chrome. ;P
