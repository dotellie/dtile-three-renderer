/**
 * This file is totally ripped from three's internal PlaneBufferGeometry.
 * https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/geometries/PlaneGeometry.js
 *
 * There are two reasons why I didn't reuse the existing one:
 *  1. An additional attribute is required for opacity.
 *  2. The original PlaneGeometry has Y going up. DTile is optimised for
 *     reversed y-axis operations.
 * The fist problem could have been solved without doing this, but the second
 * one couldn't. Hence, I pretty much just copied the entire thing.
